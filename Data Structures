   The important takeaways from this article can be summed as follows:

A) Array means contiguous memory. It can exist in any memory section be it Data or Stack or Heap.
B) Linked List means non-contiguous linked memory. It can exist in any memory section be it Heap or Data or Stack.
C) As a programmer, looking at a data structure from a memory perspective could provide us with better insight in 
  choosing a particular data structure or even designing a new data structure. For example, we might create an array
  of linked lists etc.
