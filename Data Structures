   The important takeaways from this article can be summed as follows:

A) Array means contiguous memory. It can exist in any memory section be it Data or Stack or Heap.
B) Linked List means non-contiguous linked memory. It can exist in any memory section be it Heap or Data or Stack.
C) As a programmer, looking at a data structure from a memory perspective could provide us with better insight in 
  choosing a particular data structure or even designing a new data structure. For example, we might create an array
  of linked lists etc.

--> Union-Find Algorithm can be used to check whether an undirected graph contains cycle or not. Note that we have
discussed an algorithm to detect cycle. This is another method based on Union-Find. This method assumes that the
graph doesn’t contain any self-loops.

--> Detect Cycle using 3 colors.

--> UNION FIND Algo (Optimized) : O(logn)

--> The longest path problem for a general graph is not as easy as the shortest path problem because the longest 
path problem doesn’t have optimal substructure property. In fact, the Longest Path problem is NP-Hard for a general
graph. However, the longest path problem has a linear time solution for directed acyclic graphs. The idea is similar
to linear time solution for shortest path in a directed acyclic graph., we use Topological Sorting.

--> Topological Sorting for a graph is not possible if the graph is not a DAG.  (WHY)
